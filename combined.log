Feeling empty can be a really difficult experience. It sounds like things might be feeling a bit numb or perhaps like you're lacking your usual spark. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nSometimes, that feeling of emptiness can creep in when we've been dealing with a lot, or if things in our lives have shifted recently. Have there been any changes or challenges that you've been navigating lately?\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here, and it's okay if you're not sure why you're feeling this way. Just know that I'm here to listen and help you explore this feeling a little more. Perhaps, as we talk, we can start to understand what might be contributing to it and find ways to bring some color back into things.
